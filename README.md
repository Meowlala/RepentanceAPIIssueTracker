# Repentance API Issue Tracker
An unofficial issue tracker for issues with The Binding of Isaac: Repentance's API.

This repository exists purely to use the issue tracker, and does not host code of its own, excepting examples and test cases.

## Labels

Some useful labels are provided to tag issues with. They'll be added to issues as they are made.

* The "xml", "lua", and "resources" labels can be used to tag whether the issue is with modifying / extending xml files, the lua API, or with modifying other game resources, like graphics and stbs.
* The "broken function" label can be used to tag methods and variables that are exposed by the API, but do not work in any way at all. There are a lot of these, so it's useful to be able to separate them.
* The "documentation" label can be used to track issues / inconsistencies with the official documentation. Keep in mind that these are not very important, because the documentation will likely be entirely redone and unofficial versions exist.
* The "enhancement" and "bug" labels are self-explanatory, new features for / extensions to the API are enhancements, while functions with certain broken arguments or unintended behavior are bugs.
* The "convenience" label marks something that is implemented, but difficult to use / not fully featured, while not behaving in an unintended or broken way. Sort of inbetween a bug and an enhancement!
* The "repentance" label marks that an issue only applies to the Repentance version of the API
* The "fixed in patch" label marks that an issue has been fixed in an upcoming patch. When the patch comes out, the issue will be closed. If an issue is found to not actually be fixed, it should be reopened and have this label removed.
* The "meta" label is for suggestions for / problems with the issue tracker itself.
