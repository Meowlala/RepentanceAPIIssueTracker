# Repentance API Issue Tracker
An unofficial issue tracker for issues with The Binding of Isaac: Repentance's API. Currently tracking issues with the Afterbirth+ API, as Repentance's is not out yet.

This repository exists purely to use the issue tracker, and does not host code of its own, excepting examples and test cases.

## Labels

Some useful labels are provided to tag issues with. Use them!

* The "xml", "lua", and "resources" labels can be used to tag whether the issue is with modifying / extending xml files, the lua API, or with modifying other game resources, like graphics and stbs.
* The "broken function" label can be used to tag methods and variables that are exposed by the API, but do not work in any way at all. There are a lot of these, so it's useful to be able to separate them.
* The "documentation" label can be used to track issues / inconsistencies with the official documentation. Keep in mind that these are not very important, because the documentation will likely be entirely redone and unofficial versions exist.
* The "enhancement" and "bug" labels are self-explanatory, new features for / extensions to the API are enhancements, while functions with certain broken arguments or unintended behavior are bugs.
* The "meta" label is for suggestions for / problems with the issue tracker itself.
